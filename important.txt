!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

before deploying, all the controllers should have user auth check, as right now anyone can do anything, ex => go over to playlist.controller.js, there in 
deletePlaylist method, any logged in user can delete anyone's playlist, HANDLE THAT when done with core ops.
